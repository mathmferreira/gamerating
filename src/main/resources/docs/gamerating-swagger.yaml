  title: Game Rating API
  description: |-
    This is an API for rating Games and give your opinion about them.
    You just have to create your user and play with it.
    
    This API uses JWT for authentication, and it is required to access all the resources for each request.
    You can log in the application after you create your user, then get the token returned in the header of response to access the resources.
    
    ### This API allows you to:
    
    * Rating and comment games
    * Manage games for rating
    * View all the games that you rated
    * Manage your user
